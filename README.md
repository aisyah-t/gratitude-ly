## Gratitude-ly

During Phase 2 of the web development bootcamp at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/) I decided to create a prompt-based gratitude journal web app called Gratitude-ly. The aim is for a user to be able to choose a prompt to write their gratitude journal entry for. 

This project is a work in progress. It is a full-stack project, currently utilising React, Knex.js, Express.js, REST API, Skeleton CSS and Node.

I will continue to work on Gratitude-ly in the coming weeks so watch this space ;)
