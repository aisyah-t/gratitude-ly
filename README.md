# Gratitude-ly

## The idea :bulb: :writing_hand:

During Phase 2 of the Web Development Bootcamp at [Enspiral Dev Adacemy](https://devacademy.co.nz) I decided to create a prompt-based gratitude journal app called _Gratitude-ly_.

When I was introduced to the concept of gratitude journal many years ago I struggled to make it a habit as I didn't know what to write about. During bootcamp I discovered that you can search for prompts online to help get you started with gratitude journal entries.

I wanted to create _Gratitude-ly_ as a wellbeing tool for myself. When it's fully functioning I would also like to make it available for others to use.

The project is still very much a work in progress. I will be exploring React Hooks and Context for this project and changing some of the functional and design features. I also plan on incorporating unit testing for this project.

As a user, I want to:

- be welcomed to the app/page.
- read a brief explanation of the purpose of and how to use the app.
- see a list of all the prompts available for gratitude journalling.
- choose a prompt from the list and then write my journal entry for the chosen prompt.
- be able to add an image to my journal entry.
- be able to edit an existing journal entry if I've made mistakes.
- be able to delete an entry I no longer want to keep.
- be able to add my own prompt.
