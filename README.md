# Personal Project for Phase 2 of Enspiral Dev Academy Web Development Bootcamp

## Gratitude-ly

During Phase 2 of the Web Development bootcamp at EDA I decided to create a prompt-based gratitude journal web app called Gratitude-ly. The aim is for a user to be able to choose a prompt to write their gratitude journal entry for. The entries will be stored in an internal database accessible only to the individual user, just like a written journal.

The project is still a work in progress. It is a full-stack project utilising React, Knex, Express and Skeleton CSS.

I will continue to work on this project to bring it up to Minimum Viable Product stage and to include stretch features post-EDA.
